Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we‚Äôre ‚Äúold‚Äù (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we‚Äôre also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do ‚Äì you can‚Äôt put us in a box!

But ‚ÄúDigital Transformation‚Äù is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don‚Äôt care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That‚Äôs cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us"
